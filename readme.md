# Java Calculation Program

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations and print the result.

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to add two integers and display the result on the console.

## How It Works
1. The program declares two integer variables, `X` and `Y`.
2. It adds the values of `X` and `Y`, stores the result in a third variable `z`.
3. The program then prints the value of `z` to the console.

## Code Explanation
- **Variables**: 
    - `X = 5`: The first integer.
    - `Y = 10`: The second integer.
- **Operation**: The script adds `X` and `Y` and stores the result in the variable `z`.
- **Output**: The result of the addition (`15`) is printed to the console.

## Usage
To run this Java program:
1. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Compile the Java program:

   javac Calculation.java
